# UFOs

## Overview of Analysis 

The overall goal of this analysis was to create a dynamic website that displays UFO siting data, and allows the user to filter based on the specific criteria they are looking for. This was done using HTML (used to populate what we want to see on the website) and JavaScript (used to pull in, iterate through, and filter the data). I also used a CSS stylesheet to add some additional "flare" and make the site more visually appealing. 

## Results
### How to perform a search: 

On the left hand side of the website next to where the data is displayed, you will find the filters under the "Filter Search" heading. To use the filters to refine the data, all you need to do is type in what you're looking for, following the format of the placeholder text, and press enter. If you want to filter for multiple criteria, you would just do the same thing in a different filter and press enter again.

If you want to reset the filters to see all of the data again, there is a UFO Sightings button in the top left hand corner that you will click.

## Summary 
### Drawbacks & Recommendations for Further Development: 

With this analysis, I do think there are some drawbacks to the website. There were 5 filters requested for Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. I think one of the drawbacks is not having the ability to also filter by the duration of the siting or by comments. I also think there should be a spot on the website to submit additional sitings so that we are able to update and have more relevant data as time goes on. I would recommend adding both of these things in the future. 

Some of the additional drawbacks from the website that I already addressed include having the filters extend into the data when the website is not full screen, having all of the data laid out on the page so that it was just one running page, and then also not being able to see the column titles when scrolling down on the page. Outside of fixing those things I also added a spot to scroll for the text on top so when the website is not opened as the full page, you are able to scroll through that too without having the data pushed down. Finally I added some additional things in the HTML from bootstrap and updated some things in the stylesheet so that the website is clean/ visually appealing, formatted correctly, and easy to use.
